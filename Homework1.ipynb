    "## Question 1\n",
    "In class, we cleaned the Prison Policy Initiative of total populations across racial/ethnic groups. This data comes from this site: https://www.prisonpolicy.org/data/ and is titled \"U.S. Census group quarters (2010): People housed in correctional facilities for adults, by race and by gender.\" Open the excel and observe the data. In class we specifically looked at the \"Total\" sheet that shows the total persons in correctional facilities. For question #1, I want you to practice cleaning a dataset using \"Women\" sheet."

    "* Observe the data. We want to make a Black women to White women ratio of incarceration people at the state-level. Therefore, we need to clean the data (it is very similar to what we did in class workbook 2). Get rid of unnecessary observations. Rename the variables to reflect what they are measuring. We only want to keep the state, Black women, and White women variables.\n",
